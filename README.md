# XGBoost
In this notebook, I used the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. The dataset attached is comprised of 8 input variables that describe medical details of patients and one output variable to indicate whether the patient will have an onset of diabetes within 5 years. This is a good dataset for a first XGBoost model because all of the input variables are numeric and the problem is a simple binary classification problem. It is not necessarily a good problem for the XGBoost algorithm because it is a relatively small dataset and an easy problem to model.
